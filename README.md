# HOPE-Decal
We designed and assembled a PCB that plays pong! (Well we made some mistakes and the PCB didn't really work... BUT the electronics kinda works!)

More information about the project can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/hope-fall-22-showcase/mini-game-console?authuser=0).
